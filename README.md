# ðŸŽ² Casino Profit Simulator â€“ React & Next.js
This project is a React-based gambling profit simulator that demonstrates how casinos exploit the binomial equation to maintain long-term profitability. Built with Next.js, it features real-time probability calculations and interactive visualizations.

## ðŸš€ Features:
Casino Game Simulations ðŸŽ° â€“ Test different gambling scenarios.

Binomial Probability Analysis ðŸ“ˆ â€“ See how small statistical advantages generate huge profits.

Monte Carlo Simulations ðŸŽ² â€“ Visualize long-term earnings with large-scale probability experiments.

Next.js Optimization âš¡ â€“ Server-side rendering (SSR) for faster calculations and UI performance.

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming C Integration:
We plan to integrate C code for high-performance probability calculations and simulations. Stay tuned!
